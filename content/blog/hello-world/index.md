This is my first post on my new blog!

Today I'm starting a blog filled with with interesting posts about programming, computer science, personal stories and lots more.

I'm looking forward to create small projects just for the purpose of writing about it and hope to learn a lot of stuff as I go along. The first few posts will be about how I created or will create this blog, what technologies I use and how you will be able to do the same.

## why

Fist of all I like to create stuff and want to share the process behind it. But most importantly I want to learn new technologies and concepts by explaining it to you.

## how

I'm using [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as the two main technologies behind this blog. As a hosting service I currently use [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) I will constantly improve the codebase and try to keep you informed what and how I did it.

## about me

I'm a computer science student located in dortmund, germany. My main interest in this lays in the everlasting  growing field of web development. I also work at [Knipp](https://www.knipp.de/) as a student assistant.
